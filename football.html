            There have been many Argentine players with the mantle of ‘The Next Maradona’. Pablo Aimar, Alessandro D’Alessandro, Ariel Ortega and many others. None of them lived up to that title.<br/>

                    <p>There’s always debate about who’s the greatest football player of all time. Pele was the first to be unanimously awarded that title and those who’ve seen him play call him the finest ever.
                      For starters, he is the only player in the world to win 3 FIFA World Cups. He burst onto the scene in the 1958 World Cup as a 17-year old and was instrumental in his country’s first World Cup win.
                      Two more titles followed in 1962 and 1970, with Pele being adjudged the best player at the 1970 World Cup. Not to forget, that the 1970 World Cup winning side is considered to be the best international football team.
                      In addition to his stupendous skill with the ball, Pele was a feared goal-scorer as his record shows. According to International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS), Pele scored 1281 goals in 1363 games at the club-level.<p>
